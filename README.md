# HealthcareAnalysis
This Power BI dashboard project focuses on analyzing patient waitlist data in the healthcare sector. The data covers different types of medical cases like Outpatient, Inpatient, and Day Case, and breaks them down by age groups, time they've been waiting, and specialties like Orthopaedics or Cardiology.

There are two main pages in the dashboard:

 1. Summary Page (Dashboard View)
    
This page gives a quick overview of the total number of patients waiting and how it's changed over time. It includes:

A total waitlist comparison: You can see how the current month's numbers compare with the same month from the previous year.

A pie chart showing what percentage of patients are Outpatients, Inpatients, or Day Cases.

A bar chart that shows which age group has been waiting for how long (e.g., 0–3 months, 3–6 months, etc.).

A trend line chart that shows how the numbers have gone up or down month by month from 2018 to 2021.

A list of top 5 medical specialties with the highest average wait times, like Accident & Emergency or Dermatology.

 2. Detailed View Page

This page lets you dig deeper into the data. You can:

Choose filters like age group, case type, or time band using dropdowns on the left.

View a detailed table showing exact numbers of patients by category and date.

See totals for each group, such as how many 16–64-year-olds have been waiting for Orthopaedic treatment for 3–6 months.

This view is useful for understanding specific problem areas or bottlenecks in the healthcare system.

 --> What This Project Helps With

This dashboard is meant to help hospitals or healthcare planners:

Identify which age groups or specialties have longer wait times.

Track how patient numbers change over time.

Make better decisions for resource planning and patient care.
